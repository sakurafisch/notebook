## [Dynamic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis)

* [sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers) 🌟 - This project is the home for Sanitizers: AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, ThreadSanitizer, LeakSanitizer, and more.
* [Valgrind](https://www.valgrind.org/) - is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.


## [Static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)

* [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) - is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code. It provides unique code analysis to detect bugs and focuses on detecting undefined behaviour and dangerous coding constructs. 
* [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) 🌟 - is a clang-based C++ “linter” tool. Its purpose is to provide an extensible framework for diagnosing and fixing typical programming errors, like style violations, interface misuse, or bugs that can be deduced via static analysis. clang-tidy is modular and provides a convenient interface for writing new checks.
* [clang-analyzer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangStaticAnalyzer.html) - is a source code analysis tool that finds bugs in C, C++, and Objective-C programs. It implements path-sensitive, inter-procedural analysis based on symbolic execution technique.
