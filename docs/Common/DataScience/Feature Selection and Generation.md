# Feature Selection and Generation

## Feature Selection

Identify those variables or features that do not contribute to the classification task. In essence select d features out of available p features. This is also referred to as  feature selection in the measurement space or feature selection.

### Optimal methods

Optimal methods can lead to globally optimal solution but are computationally expensive -- exhaustive search; accelerated search; Monte Carlo methods.

### Suboptimal methods

Suboptimal methods attempt to achieve a trade off between optimality and computational speed.

### Filter Methods

Filter methods select features independent of the classification algorithm.

### Wrapper methods

Wrapper methods select features based on the classification algorithm.

## Feature Extraction

Transform from the p-dimensional feature space to a lower dimensional space. This is sometimes referred to as feature selection in the transformed domain or feature extraction.
