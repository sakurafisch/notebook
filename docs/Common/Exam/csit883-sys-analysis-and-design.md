## Information System

Information system refers to a set of interrelated components that collects, processes, stores, and provides as output the information needed to complete business tasks

Computer application refers to a computer software program that executes on a computing device to carry out a specific set of functions.

Five elements in an information system:

1. Hardware
2. Software
3. Data
4. Processes
5. People

## System Analysis and Design

1. System analysis: What is required for the new system to solve the problem.
2. System design: How the system will operate to solve the problem.

## System Development Life Cycle(SDLC)

Project: a planned undertaking that has a beginning and end and that produces some definite result

- Used to develop an information system
- Formal or informal
- Requires knowledge of systems analysis and system design tools and techniques

System development methodology: the actual approach used to develop a particular information system

- E.g., Unified process(UP), Extreme programming(XP), Scrum, among others
- Agile development: an information system development process that emphasises flexibility to anticipate new requirements during development
  - Fast on feet
  - responsive to change
- Iterative development: an approach to system development in which the system is "grown" piece by piece through multiple iterations
  - Complete small part of system(mini-project), then repeat processes to refine and add more, then repeat to refine and add more, until done.

## Systems Analysis and Desing in SDLC

Provides the tools and techniques you need as an information system developer to complete the development process including:

- Understand the need(business need)
- Capture the vision
- Define a solution
- Communicate the vision and the solution
- Building the solution or direct others in building the solution
- Comfirm that the solution meets the need
- Launch the solution application

## The role of system analyst

System analyst: a business professional who uses analysis and design techniques to solve business problems by using information technology

Knowledge and skills required of a systems analyst:

- IT Knowledge
- Tools
- Techniques
- Understanding business organisations
- Interpersonal skills

## IT Project Management

Q: What is a Project?

A: Project is a planned undertaking that has a beginning and end and that produces some definite result.

Q: what is an IT project?

A: IT projects involve using hardware, software, and networks to create a product, service, or result.

### Project attributes

1. Project Constraints
2. Project Success

### Project Management(PM)

Q: What is Project Management?

A: The application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements

Q: What do Project Managers do?

A: Project managers strive to meet the triple constraint(project scope, time, and cost goals) and also facilitate the entire process to meet the needs and expectations of project stakeholders.

### Project Management Knowledge Areas

Knowledge area sdescribe the key competencies that project managers must develop

- Scope management
- Schedule management
- Cost management
- Quality management
- Resource management

- Risk management
- Procurement management
- Stakeholder management
- Integration management

### Project Management Tools and Techniques

- Project charter, scope statement, and WBS
- Gantt charts, network diagrams, critical path analysis, critical chain scheduling
- Cost estimates and earned value management
- Fishbone diagrams
