Plum blossom ranks the first among ten famous flowers in China. It originated in Southern China and has a history of more than 3,000 years of cultivation and planting. In the middle of winter, plum blossoms in different colors brave the cold and snow in full bloom. In traditional Chinese culture, plum blossoms symbolize strength, purity, and elegance, which encourage people to face hardship and forge ahead. Since ancient times, many poets and painters have taken inspiration from plum blossoms and created numerous immortal works. The general public also likes plum blossoms. During the Spring Festival, plum blossoms are often used for home decoration. And the city of Nanjing has designated the plum blossom as its city flower. Each year, a plum blossom festival will be held and thousands of people will brave the cold to visit the Plum Blossom Mountain to enjoy the scene of snow and plum blossoms.
